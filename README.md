This is my Pokedex project to help me learn JavaScript and UI technology.

The page uses JavaScript and an API to provide and format data, while Bootstrap is used to 
format the display. The tools were used in a simple way so as to learn the fundamentals. I used a modal to display each pokemon's information on the screen, and a brief loading message pops up whenever the page is loaded or a button is clicked.
